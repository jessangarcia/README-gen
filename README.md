## Installation 
*Steps required to install project and how to get the development environment running:*
*npm install
*install inquirer
*clone repo to your own desktop
    
## Usage
![demo](./images/readmegengif.gif)

Once everything is cloned onto your desktop and you have added the npm install and inquirer to your dependencies, then you will need to open your terminal your application in running on. Type in 'node index' to run in the terminal. Answer the questions you are prompted with, and once you finish you will get a little message in the terminal saying 'README created' and you will find your new README.md in the 'dist' folder. Then you can check for any typos or remove anything you changed your mind on, and you can add pictures. Check your Preview to make sure everything is the way you want it to be.
